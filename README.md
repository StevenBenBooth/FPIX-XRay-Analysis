# FPIX-XRay-Analysis

Developed for the Cornell CMS Team, 2022. This program is for image processing on cross-sections of Carbon foam/fiber + tubing CT scans.

To make updates and build your own version of the GUI, you can run 'pyinstaller --clean gui_driver.spec' on the command line (if pyinstaller is not installed, run 'pip install pyinstaller' first).
